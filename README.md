# WaterPotabilityDeepLearning

This project uses a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) to predict whether a given water sample is safe to drink. The goal is to build a model that’s highly precise, reducing the chance of incorrectly labeling unsafe water as potable — a critical concern for health and safety.
